Workflow

Get Job Directory
Check for archives, expand them if Necessary (internal tool, PS-tooling for this is fine, force people to upgrade
Find all *Job*.log files (accidental matches are fine as string match will simply fail)
Split Date from XML content, write as separate elements in array
Loop over array to check XML history
ÃŸ

Check the most recent XML (XML'1) as the base comparison and write it to file.

If we find a difference in XML'N, append XML'N to file, set XML'N as new base comparison, and continue

Each difference should write the specific changed nodes ($result.InputObject) You can get node name with

$Result.InputObject
